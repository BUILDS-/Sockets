Questions:
Decisions:
	Implemented TCP echo client and server using book code and own techniques. The functional programs reside in unpv13e\ 2/tcpcliserv/ and are called tcpserv01 and tcpcli01.
Todo:
	Nothing.
Comments/notes:
	We should figure out how to not rely on the header files provided by the book. Having nested folders like this seems to be a bit of a holdup.
